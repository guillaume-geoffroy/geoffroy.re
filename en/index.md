I am a visiting assisting professor (ATER) at [I2M](https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/) (institut de math√©matiques de Marseille). My advisor is [Laurent Regnier](https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/perso/laurent.regnier/). My research topics include classical realizability, denotational semantics of programs and other subjects connected to mathematics, computer science and logic.

I am also vice-president and one of the founders of [Pi Day association](https://www.piday.fr), a non-profit organization for popularization of mathematics. Among other things, we produce [mathematical musicals](http://www.piday.fr/extraits-video-2017/)!
