I am an associate professor at [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/en/), the theoretical computer science lab at [Universit√© de Paris](https://u-paris.fr/en/). My research lies at the junction between mathematics, computer science and logic and includes such topics as classical realizability and denotational semantics of programs (particularly probabilistic programs).

I am also one of the founders of [Pi Day association](https://www.piday.fr), a non-profit organisation for popularisation of mathematics. Among other things, we produce [mathematical musicals](http://www.piday.fr/extraits-video-2017/)!
