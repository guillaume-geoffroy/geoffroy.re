I am a post-doc at the [department of computer science and engineering](https://www.cs.unibo.it) of the university of Bologna. I work with [Ugo Dal Lago](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~dallago/) on project [DIAPASoN -- Differential Program Semantics](https://site.unibo.it/diapason/). More generally, my research lies at the junction between mathematics, computer science and logic and includes such topics as classical realizability and denotational semantics of programs (particularly probabilistic programs).

I am also vice-president and one of the founders of [Pi Day association](https://www.piday.fr), a non-profit organization for popularization of mathematics. Among other things, we produce [mathematical musicals](http://www.piday.fr/extraits-video-2017/)!
